# Git Training by Akamai Advanced Solutions Team
This repository is designed to provide a basic introduction to Git and Github with minimal trauma and hazing (hopefully). PRs welcome to make it even better.
Testing only a change on a new branch!

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.
Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
